# Fastest-Runner
A simple JavaScript app that runs online. Asks you to type in three marathon runners time and it judges the fastest. <br>
Needs a live server in order to run.
Its an app simply made in order to understand the basics and how to give user inputs an a page (popup window where you put the times you wanna judge). It takes these inputs and compares them.
